This directory contains integration tests for C++ Levitation mode.
You may also find some scripts here. Those a probably not best formed scripts.
I created them for converting old bash-based tests into llvm-lit compatible.
Each test directory contains build.sh, which can be used to
generate llvm-lit test script (which is fake .cpp file).
